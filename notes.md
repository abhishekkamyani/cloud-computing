# Introduction to Cloud Computing

## Chapter 1: Introduction to Cloud Computing

### 1. What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is a technology that allows users to access computing resources (like servers, storage, databases, networking, software) over the internet instead of relying on a personal computer or a local server. It enables users to store data and run applications remotely without needing high-end hardware.

**Example:**
Think of cloud computing like Google Drive or Dropbox, where you can store files online and access them from any device.

### 2. Operations in Cloud Computing
Cloud computing consists of different operations that help manage and utilize cloud services efficiently. These include:

1. **Computing Power:** Running applications on virtual machines instead of local computers.
2. **Storage Management:** Storing data on cloud-based servers rather than on local hard drives.
3. **Networking:** Connecting users and applications globally through the internet.
4. **Security Management:** Protecting data through encryption, authentication, and firewalls.
5. **Resource Allocation:** Distributing computing resources as per demand to ensure efficiency.
